/*
This is the basic setup for the database. 
To get this to run on your computer, you need to create a .env file and define DATABASE_URL. 
Due to security issues, I have uploaded it separately to the shared drive and you can put it
in the root directory. Once you have .env, run (in the terminal)

npm run devStart

This runs the development version of the server using nodemon. As of now, the website is not 
hooked up to heroku/an actual server, but the website will show up at localhost:3000. 

This isn't hooked up to Shida's signup page, but that will come at a later date.
